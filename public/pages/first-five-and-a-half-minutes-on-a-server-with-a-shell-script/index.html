            <h1>First Five (and a Half) Minutes on a Server with a Shell Script</h1>
            <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 29, 2014</span>
            

<p>About a year ago I wrote <a href="/pages/first-five-and-a-half-minutes-on-a-server-with-ansible">this</a> about hardening a fresh server using Ansible. This post has received about 10x as much traffic as anything else I&rsquo;ve written. Oddly, admin is the area I&rsquo;m probably least knowledgable about when it comes to software.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Ansible script I wrote about in that post is out of date. I realized this recently after trying to use it on a fresh install. I went about updating it (Ansible has made some breaking changes since then) and came to the realization that it would be faster and easier to just write a shell script.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Ansible (and tools like it) don&rsquo;t have their place. They obviously do. But for one-off installs or occasional use the learning curve is too steep. It&rsquo;s much easier to stay current with shell scripting than it is to stay current with a tool that is constantly being changed (improved) and meant for administering very large installations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve stripped this down a bit from the original version. Logwatch, in particular, seemed more annoying than useful. You may or may not want to install that yourself.</p>

<h3 id="danger">Danger</h3>

<p>A couple of notes about using this:</p>

<ul>
<li>This script does two things that when combined can render your instance unusable: It creates a new user and password and disallows ssh from logging in as root. If something goes wrong with the creation of the new user you&rsquo;ll be locked out and / or won&rsquo;t be able to make any root-level changes.</li>
<li>Also in the potentially unusable category: This script overwrites your /etc/sudoers file. If anything goes wrong here you&rsquo;ll probably have to start over from scratch.</li>
<li>The script isn&rsquo;t idempotent. For all practical purposes, the individual actions are idempotent, but you should be aware of that.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, only run this on a fresh install and be prepared to have to start over from scratch if anything goes wrong.</p>

<h3 id="simple-fast">Simple, Fast</h3>

<p>The upside to using this is it&rsquo;s easy to change with only basic shell scripting knowledge and it&rsquo;s faster than Ansible to run. Much faster actually. Having said that, Ansible may have made improvements in speed since I used it last.</p>

<p>To actually run it, just run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lattejed/5047d9f85896b8946c7d/raw/e3534c6ac5248ad7bc711c053fec45c22441c87a/gistfile1.sh &gt; secure_ubuntu_10.04_x64.sh
scp secure_ubuntu_10.04_x64.sh root@&lt;ip_address or host&gt;:/root/
ssh root@&lt;ip_address or host&gt; chmod +x secure_ubuntu_10.04_x64.sh
ssh root@&lt;ip_address or host&gt; ./secure_ubuntu_10.04_x64.sh
</code></pre>
