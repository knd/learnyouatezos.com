            <h1>Why this Site is now Self Hosted</h1>
            <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 19, 2016</span>
            <p><strong>Note: While this site is still self-hosted, it&rsquo;s now managed by Hugo so most of what&rsquo;s below doesn&rsquo;t apply</strong></p>

<p>This site, now in its <del>current brutalist form</del>, has been hosted in a few different places over the years. I don&rsquo;t write that often but I&rsquo;ve made some effort to maintain a site since I got into software. That&rsquo;s usually meant picking a decent blog hosting platform and writing something about 1/10th of the times I&rsquo;ve thought I should. I&rsquo;ve used Tubmlr, Posterous, Posthaven (the post sale reboot of Posterous), GitHub and was considering Medium and then said fuck it, I&rsquo;ll just put it on a server somewhere and be done with it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simplicity. A static website is an exceedingly simple thing. I&rsquo;d rather just write one in vim than deal with a webpage-as-text-editor.</li>
<li>Style. <del>While this site may be (intentionally) ugly</del>, it was exaclty what I wanted and didn&rsquo;t require dealing with a theme interface nor did someone else decide what my site should look like for aesthetic or technlogical reasons.</li>
<li>Dumbed down services. Hosting a site for any length of time almost invariably requires redirects or file hosting or a form or whatever. Existing services don&rsquo;t provide some or all of these.</li>
<li>Performance. It&rsquo;s really hard to beat a VPS from a decent provider (I use Digital Ocean) with CloudFlare&rsquo;s free plan as a CDN. If my site is simple I expect it to load in a microsecond. Most servies aren&rsquo;t that great.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was actually hosting this most recent version on GitHub. GitHub&rsquo;s offering has a lot of nerd appeal. You can edit locally, deploy with a <code>git push</code>, they&rsquo;ve got a CDN (as far as I know) and it&rsquo;s free or included in whatever plan you&rsquo;ve already got with them.</p>

<p>Then I spent 45 minutes trying to figure out how people set up 301s when using gh-pages and was disappointed to find out they don&rsquo;t. Some people recommend using refresh and canonical meta tags on a basic page (supposedly SEO acceptible). There&rsquo;s even a Jekyll plugin for it. To me that just sounds silly.</p>

<p>Also, Jekyll. Whenever you push to GitHub it treats your site as a Jekyll site and tries to &ldquo;compile&rdquo; it. Even if it&rsquo;s not a Jekyll site. It fails sometime without reason and &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; it usually means pushing empty commits until it works.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point wasn&rsquo;t to complain about hosting a site on GitHub, but rather the fact that these services will likely end up costing you more time than they&rsquo;re worth. Setting up nginx or apache to host a static site isn&rsquo;t very complicated and it&rsquo;s a much better skill to learn than the quirks of some service.</p>

            <p>Originally from the US, I've spent most of my post-college years as a resident of Bangkok, a city of award-winning chefs, beautiful people, traffic jams and the ocassional coup d'etat.</p>
            <p>I like tackling hard problems, most recently at the intersection of computer graphics, computational geomerty and product design while creating <a href="http://model3d.co">Model3D, a 3D modeler for iPad Pro and Apple Pencil</a>.</p>
            <p>Former co-founder of a PR agency, I found my true calling as a software engineer / entrepreneur. I've spent the last decade building products and consulting for iOS and macOS and have learned a dozen or so computer languages.</p> 
            <p>When I'm not working I spend time with my family. My wife Onne is GM of a company under the <a href="http://dwp.com">dwp</a> umbrella. My son Hadrian attends St. Andrews in central Bangkok.</p>
