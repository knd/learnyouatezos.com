<h3 id="-enter-the-blockchain"> Enter the Blockchain</h3>
<p>First of all, what is a blockchain?</p>
<p><em>A blockchain is a secure, distributed and Byzantine-fault tolerant ledger of transactions.</em></p>
<p>While a large portion of humans may view blockchains as "digital money", this is a poor analogy. When we think of money we tend to think of physical money &mdash; coins and bills. These have copy protections (in their designs and legally) and can only be, by the laws of physics, in one place at one time.</p>
<p>It's impossible to create a digital good that shares those attributes. Because they are pure information, they will always be freely copyable. Imagine saying the number '123456789' is worth a million dollars!</p>
<p>But if we extend our "digital money" analogy into, say, bank transfers, things make sense. Of course banks dont physically transfer money (in most cases), they simply update a ledger of debits and credits.</p>
<p>A ledger is something that can represent the transfer of value (and therefore value itself) and can be designed in such a way that they're not copyable.</p>
<h3 id="-whiteboard-analogy"> Whiteboard Analogy</h3>
<p>Imagine we are opening a bank.</p>
<p>In order to keep track of everyone's credits and debits, we're going to use a white board.</p>
<p>Because this white board represents millions or even billions of dollars, we have to ensure that no one modifies transactions they're not authorized to.</p>
<p>If everyone's bank transactions &mdash; and therefore bank balance &mdash; is on a whiteboard, the addition of a single "0" could make someone a whole lot richer. Or, a quick erasure could bankrupt your arch enemy!</p>
<h3 id="privatecentralizedmodelinsidewhiteboard">Private, Centralized Model (Inside Whiteboard)</h3>
<p>Because our ledger is so sensitive, we're going to do the most sane thing possible: We're going to lock it in a vault and make sure only select people have access to that vault. If our vault is secure, our whiteboard is secure.</p>
<p>This works perfectly fine if everyone trusts the bank &mdash; and trusts the bank not to raise fees to be unreasonable or to not deny banking to "undesirable" people (where undesirable could mean someone who challenges prevailing political opinions).</p>
<p>But what if we want to do the same without trusting the bank?</p>
<h3 id="publicdecentralizedmodeloutsidewhiteboard">Public, Decentralized Model (Outside Whiteboard)</h3>
<p>Now, if keeping billions of dollars worth of transactions on a whiteboard in a vault wasn't crazy enough, let's put the whiteboard <em>outside, in the bank's parking lot</em>!</p>
<p>Obviously this is crazy, now anyone can erase transactions, add zeros, do anything they want to anyone's account, including their own.</p>
<p><em>But this is precisely what blockchain allows us to do.</em> Is it magic? Kind of.</p>
<p>It's a novel combination of our three fundamental ideas:</p>
<h3 id="-foundations-of-blockchain"> Foundations of Blockchain</h3>
<p>Blockchains are built on three fundamental ideas or technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<li>Peer to Peer Networking</li>
<li>Game Theory</li>
</ol>
<p>Like the Internet (a network of computers) and Computer Science in general, these are <em>relatively</em> new ideas (i.e., having been largely developed in the last few decades) (TODO: check this).</p>
<p>In blockchain, these concepts have been combined in a unique way to solve a unique problem: How do we create a cooperating network, without a central authority, where the network may be unreliable and parts of the network may be hostile towards the whole!</p>
<p>More specifically, how do we create a public, shared resources (a ledger of transactions) that is secure from hostile actors without relying on centralization or privatization.</p>
<h3 id="-cryptography"> Cryptography</h3>
<p>Cryptography, precisely <em>Public Key Cryptography</em> is <em>already</em> the backbone of the Internet as we know it. Without Public Key Cryptography, there would be no HTTPS, no secure logins, no e-commerce, no Internet banking.</p>
<p>In short, Public Key Cryptography allows to to create a secret number (a private key) and <em>derive</em> a non-secret number (a public key) in such a way that we can encrypt a message with a public key &mdash; and that message can only be decrypted with the private key.</p>
<p>(We can encrypt with a private key and decrypt with a public key, but that's usually called 'signing' and is used to prove ownership of a private key.)</p>
<p>What's more, we can easily derive a public key from our private key, but it's computationally infeasible to derive our private key from our public key. Mathematically, it involves prime numbers and is a type of one-way or trapdoor function.</p>
<p>It works because it's simple to multiple numbers together, but on the other hand, it takes a <em>long time</em> to factor prime numbers, where <em>long time</em> can be billions of years.</p>
<p>Public Key Cryptography is used extensively in blockchain, with its most fundamental use being the derivation of keypairs for crypto wallets. A public key, in essence, becomes an address that coins can be sent to and the matching private key is the secret needed to send money <em>out of</em> that address.</p>
<h3 id="-p2p"> P2P</h3>
<p>Peer to Peer networking is another foundational element to blockchain, with the main idea being that individual computers participating with a blockchain (nodes) are equal: There is (usually) no central node or authority.</p>
<p>Additionally, each node generally holds a complete copy of the list of transactions that the blockchain contains.</p>
<p>This is somewhat similar to BitTorrent, where many nodes may have a complete copy of a pirated movie, each sending a piece of it to someone requesting that movie. By many nodes having a full copy of the movie, it muddies the legal waters to the point where it's infeasible to prosecute individual participants or shut them down.</p>
<p>(There are non-pirating reasons to use BitTorrent as well, such as increased download speeds, censorship resistance, etc. but we won't go any deeper.)</p>
<h3 id="-game-theory"> Game Theory</h3>
<p>The fundamental limitation of Peer-to-Peer networks is exactly their strength. That is, their key benefit is that they operate without a central authority.</p>
<p>That is also their biggest challenge. If we <em>don't</em> have a central authority (no whiteboard in a vault) how do we ensure the network isn't manipulated by nefarious actors?</p>
<p>If anyone can update the network, how to we prevent nodes from giving themselves huge bank balances with transactions created out of thin air?</p>
<p>This is where Game Theory comes into play. This problem is usually referred to as the Byzantine Generals Problem, which is based on a related (but simpler) problem known as the Two Generals Problem.</p>
