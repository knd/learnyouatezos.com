<h3 id="why-tezos">Why Tezos</h3>
<p>Tezos is arguably a "Generation 3" blockchain. Its design addresses a number of issues that have plagued the first two generations (very loosely: Bitcoin and then Ethereum et al). It is designed to be secure, energy and capital efficient, seamlessly adapt to change and be as decentralized in practice as possible.</p>
<p>Tezos is the kind of project you'd likely dismiss as <em>too ambitious</em> if it weren't for the fact that it's alive and well and has largely delivered on its promises.</p>

<h3 id="addresses-what-issues">Addresses what issues</h3>
<p>First and foremost, Tezos address the two most critical issues in blockchain today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blockchain Security</li>
<li>Blockchain Forks</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="securityhacksbugs">Security: Hacks &amp; Bugs</h4>
<p>Blockchain has become synonymous with digital money. Even when it's not filling that role, the smart contracts built on top these blockchains are almost always handling non-trivial amounts of value. An error or an exploit on a blockchain can be <em>expensive</em> and real life hacks and bugs have seen costs in the <em>hundreds of millions of dollars</em>. </p>
<p>That security isn't more of a focus at this point speaks to the immaturity of these technologies and these markets.</p>
<p>While it's not possible to eliminate bugs, the language and design choices made by Tezos does eliminate whole classes of bugs, significantly reducing the ways in which things can go wrong. </p>
<p>More precisely, Tezos allows for the formal verification of its smart contracts. In addition, its core technologies allow for the same and Tezos is based on a number of formally verified components, including critical areas like cryptography. We'll cover formal verification in more depth later.</p>
<h4 id="forkshardsoft">Forks: Hard &amp; Soft</h4>
<div class="aside">
<p><strong>Ethereum DAO hack</strong></p>
<p>Although not the first security incident for a blockchain, the Ethereum DAO hack may be the prototypical crisis that highlights both of these issues. A bug (an unintended feature) allowed a hacker to remove $XXX millions worth of Ethereum from the DAO.</p>

<p>Ethereum's response to that was a hard fork -- which was a hard turn from their positions that 'code is law'. The hard fork required (a centralized) participation from the majority of miners and created two incompatible version of the blockchain in the process.</p>
