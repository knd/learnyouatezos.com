<h2>Why my Nom de Guerre is Latte Jed</h2>

<p>I've been asked a few times why I go by "Latte, Jed?" online. I know I'm dating myself here but I grew up on the cartoonist Gary Larson's <i>The Far Side</i>. If you haven't already, avail yourself of his work. He's undoubtedly the king of surrealist cartoons -- lighthearted but intelligent.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that at the time he drew this coffee culture in America was nothing like it is today. A <i>caff√® latte</i> was a relatively exotic thing, so having a cowboy produce an espresso machine was particularly funny.</p>
