<p><i><%= site.title %></i> is a free e-book that will help you get started with
the Tezos blockchain.</p> 

<p>This book will be helpful for founders / CTOs deciding on adoption, aspiring bakers, smart contract authors or people just wanting to run a node for fun.</p>

technologies, server administration or software development.</p>
