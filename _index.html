<p><img width="100px" src="./img/me.jpg"></p>

<p>Matthew Smith *</p>

<p>Born in the US, I've spent half my life as a resident of Bangkok, a city of award-winning chefs, beautiful people, traffic jams and the occassional coup d'etat.</p>

<p>I'm a serial entrepreneur, though not the billionaire, private jet kind. I like making things, which include companies, software and video games.</p>

<p>I love playing video games, eating at fancy restaurants and spending time with my wife and son. My wife is GM of a company in the field of architecture. My son teaches me something new every day.</p>

<p>Always happy to talk. Email me at <a href="mailto:m@lattejed.com">m@lattejed.com</a>.</p>
