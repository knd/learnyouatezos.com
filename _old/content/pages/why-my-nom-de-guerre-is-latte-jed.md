I've been asked a few times why I go by "Latte, Jed?" online. I know I'm dating myself here but I grew up on the cartoonist Gary Larson's *The Far Side*. If you haven't already, avail yourself of his work. He's undoubtedly the king of surrealist cartoons -- lighthearted but intelligent.

The panel in question is this:

Keep in mind that at the time he drew this coffee culture in America was nothing like it is today. A *caff√® latte* was a relatively exotic thing, so having a cowboy produce an espresso machine was particularly funny.
