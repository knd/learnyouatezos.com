## Learn You a ...

If you've learned (or attempted to learn) the Haskell programming language, you're most likely familiar with Miran Lipovaƒça's excellent [*Learn You a Haskell for Great Good*](http://learnyouahaskell.com). The title and many style elements of this book are gratuitously lifted from that one. That's because this book has a very similar goal: To be both approachable and thorough in order to help people go from zero to productive in an exciting (and complex) new technology.

## Goals of this book

This book strives to bring people up to speed on Tezos regardless of their aims.

Technology leaders and founders should find it useful for deciding why Tezos should be the blockchain of choice for their next project. New bakers should be able to use this book to start a new baking operation. Smart contract writers should get a head start for writing smart contracts that run on the Tezos blockchain. Enthusiasts should find it useful as well.

Hopefully that's not *overly* ambitious. These topics overlap to a large degree and to learn Tezos for one purpose will inform the others.

As stated above, a main goal of this book is to be both approachable (light hearted, literally and figuratively colorful, appropriately paced) but also be *thorough* and exacting. The magic of *Learn You a Haskell* is that is assumes little to no prior knowledge and almost never leaves the reader scratching their head, left on their own to figure something out.

And that's an achievement for a topic as complex and abstract as Haskell &mdash; a programming language that can be challenging to learn even for seasoned software engineers.

If this book captures even a little bit of spirit of its namesake, the author will consider it a success.

## About the author

Matthew Smith is a technology consultant, software engineer and sometimes entrepreneur. In a previous career, he owned a PR agency. Hopefully both of those careers assist in making this book useful to people interested in Tezos.

He also participated in the Tezos ICO, runs a private baker and is a long-term holder of XTZ. Previously he was in the Ethereum ICO (pre-sale). He believes Tezos will deliver on a lot of the promises Tezos' predecessors (should) have made.
