###Practical Solutions (PoW & PoS)

Whereas BFT was originally formulated in networks where the conspiring may be de-facto and related to failure, in the case of blockchain we are primarily guarding against actual conspiracies to steal value or create chaos. 

That is, we're designing systems that can deal successfully with *actual* bad actors -- nefarious crypto hackers who attempt to (and sometimes do) steal millions of dollars in crypto assets.

The most frequently used protocols in blockchain today are Proof of Work (like Bitcoin) and Proof of Stake (like Tezos). While they are very different in operation, they both are designed with the same end goal: To make these networks Byzantine fault tolerant. 

Where they are similar is this: They both, in essence, make it too expensive for individual participants to act in bad faith and "take over" a network.
