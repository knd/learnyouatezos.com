If you follow this blog, which analytics tells me you don't, you'll notice it keeps changing hosting tech, posts get dropped and other chaos. That's because I've both neglected this blog *and* keep telling myself to write more.

But because I'm an obsessive software engineer, I have to start with setting the blog up in a way that makes me happy.

After a few different tries (posthaven, ghost, hugo) I wrote a simple generator in node.js and am currently hosting on a Dokku setup.

For the time being I'm happy with this. Who knows when I'll change it again. Excelsior!
