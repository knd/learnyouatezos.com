I just doubled my [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) holdings.

Back [here](/i-just-invested-in-tezos.html) I talked about why I invested in Tezos. I also made the prediction that the market would crash (two or three times) before Tezos took off. It looks like we're in downturn number one.

Tezos is currently *below* ICO price in the mid $0.30s. While people keep telling me that crypto is now a terrible investment, I'm pretty sure investing 101: Buy Low, Sell High, still holds.

It amazes me how many people forget the basics and invest based on emotion. Markets don't die, they just slow down for a while. Buy on the dips.
